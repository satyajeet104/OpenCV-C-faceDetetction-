This is a program written in C++ for face-detection. The program has been made in Visual Studio Community 2017 using Opencv 3.3.0 .

The attempt was to implement the face-detetcion using concepts of OOP's such as Inheritance, member and friend functions, classes etc.

The screenshots of the program can be seen in the repository itself the files are named as sc1.png and sc.png and the working of sleep detection algorithm has been shown in the sc3.wmv video which is a part of this repository.

To run the program just run the .sln file subject to conditions that you have done the linking of the program file with opencv.
